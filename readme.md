**Lesson 1:**
Contains a class with 4 distinct methods that are used to:
1. calculate the sum of N odd numbers.
2. calculate the sum of N even numbers.
3. calculate the sum of N prime numbers.

The applied knowledge include:
1. Access modifiers. 
2. Data types.
3. Variables.
4. Loops.
5. If instruction.

**Lesson 3**
Contains a package with 5 class, one of the is an abstract class and that are used to:
1. Defining an abstract method to characterize the objects of the inheriting classes.
2. Created constructors in the inheriting classes.

The applied knowledge include:

1. The principle of abstraction.
2. Abstract methods.
3. The principles if inheriting classes.
4. Access modifiers.
5. Constraction.
6. Get methods.
7. The creation of objects.
